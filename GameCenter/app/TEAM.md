### Meeting Notes
1. Meeting 11/17/2018
    * Primitively established the two games we are adding
        - Simon Game
            * Game requires players to remember order of four different buttons that will light up
            * the sequence that players need to remember will increase by 1 each turn
            * Problems to Solve:
                1> Animation for lighting up each button
                2> Period of Displaying and when it's player's turn to click buttons
                3> Disable button input at displaying time
                4> Maybe use ScheduledAtFixedRate (idea from StackOverflow)
                5> Maybe not just four buttons, make it more complex
        - Snake Game
            * Unnecessary to have save method (does make sense to have one either)
            * Problems to Solve:
                1> Make fruit appear randomly on the board
                2> fruit cannot overlap with the snake's body
                3> boundaries of the board
                4> increase size of the snake
                5> Animations
        - Push the Box
            * Push the box to certain destinations
            * Problems to Solve:
                1> How to create maps
                2> Jump between different levels
                3> One hard level or multiple levels?
                4> How to determine player has wined
                5> How to display figure(who push the box)
                6> Transition between levels
    * Wrap up code from phase 1
        - Determined we want to use Coco's phase 1 group's structure
        - learning and applying MVC design
        - Divide up the work

2. Meeting 11/24/2018
    * Testing the codes we already have

        - iterate over sequence and verify
        - generate sequence again after all verifications are done
        - game over when verify failed
        - Start a new cycle repeating everything above from the beginning
    * What to do after game over ?
        - Return to local game center
        - Display this game's score
        - Or display scoreboard
        - Let user choose to play again?
